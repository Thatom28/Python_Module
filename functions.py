# why we need functions :
# 1. to avoid repetition and duplication (not DRY
#functions are a way to pack your logic together)


#declaration/ definition
def sum(a, b):  #a nad b are parameters or arguments
  return a + b #function body
  #calling the function
#we have abstracted the logic(because we do not need to know what the implimentation is about)
print("the sum is ", sum(1, 2))
